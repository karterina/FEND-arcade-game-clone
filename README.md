# Classic Arcade Game Clone

A Udacity project, part of the Front End Web Developer nanodegree. This project is designed to train OOP using JavaScript.

## How to run the game

1. Clone or download repo's zip file to your local machine.
2. Open index.html file in a browser of your choice.
3. Enjoy your time spent with those lovely giant bugs!

## How to play

* You are the Pink Girl at the bottom of the field. Use arrow keys (left, right, up, down) to navigate the field.
* The goal is to get to the water across the road without colliding with any of the bugs.
* Collision with a bug results in the character resetting to the initial position. This means you've lost. Background changes to red as a sign of failure.
* Getting to the water at the top means you've won. The character gets back to the starting point so that you can play again. Background changes to blue as a sign of relaxation and bliss.
* Enjoy!
